# Replica_Homepage

Creating a replica of a website involves multiple steps and considerations, and it's important to clarify that replicating an existing website without permission might infringe on copyright and intellectual property rights.


• This approach follows ethical guidelines by respecting copyright and intellectual property rights.


• It focuses on HTML and CSS to replicate the visual aspect of the website while keeping functionality minimal.


• It encourages learning by reverse-engineering and understanding how websites are structured and styled.


• It helps build skills in HTML and CSS, which are fundamental for web development.


• Remember that creating a replica for learning purposes is different from copying a website for commercial or unethical reasons. Always ensure that your actions align with legal and ethical standards.
